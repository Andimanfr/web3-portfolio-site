    bio: `Hi, I'm Kamila! 

I began my web development journey 8 years ago and for the last 2 have committed myself to learning web3 technologies.

I have considerable experience with solidity and rust and have developed dozens of smart contracts for ethereum/solana.

I also have considerable experience with nextjs, typescript, and postgres, which has become my stack of choice for most dapps.

I was born in Mexico City and moved to the US when I was was 15. Because of this I am fluent in both Spanish and English.

Shortly after moving to the US, I studied computer science at the Rochester Institiute of Technology where I graduated with a 3.95 GPA

After school, I worked as a fullstack engineer at Target for 3 years where I primarily worked on supply chain API's and UI's. 

I then decided that enterprise life is not for me and hopped into the world of startups where I've been enjoying my time working with small teams!`,
